                We use your name and phone number to add you to the correct WhatsApp group and
                Zoom sessions for your batch, and to reach you about your membership. We don&apos;t
                use your information for anything beyond running the community — no marketing
                lists, no reselling, no sharing with unrelated third parties.

                THC does not process payments or store any payment information. Membership fees
                are paid manually via the UPI IDs or manager contacts shown on the Register page —
                we never see or store your card, bank, or UPI app credentials.

                doesn&apos;t control how WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram handle your data.

                Our signal data and your registration details are stored with our infrastructure

                always your choice and doesn&apos;t affect anything stored on this site.
